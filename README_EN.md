# Overview
In the Computer Builder project, I developed a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) where users can explore and assemble computer configurations. 
This application utilizes the JavaScript fetch function to retrieve data about computer components from various web APIs, parsing this data into objects. 
To achieve responsive and fluid interactions, asynchronous server communication is implemented using JavaScript promises, with error handling introduced through Promise errors and try-catch blocks. 
The user interface is dynamically updated with new data rendered through JavaScript Document libraries, providing an interactive and engaging experience. 
Additionally, the application's state and user selections are managed using JavaScript's localStorage, enhancing usability. 
Through the combination of these technologies and methodologies, the project delivers real-time updates and a seamless user experience, effectively addressing the complexity of computer assembly in a user-friendly format.

# Objective
- Implement client-to-server communication using a network communication library.
- Dynamically fetch data from the server on the web client and render it.
- Be proficient in Web API and URL endpoints.
- Understand the concept of JSON and utilize it for data retrieval and storage.
- Utilize client-side storage for storing and managing client data.
- Construct Single Page Applications (SPAs) incorporating dynamic rendering, asynchronous processing, and event listeners.
- Interpret documentation for third-party Web APIs and implement the required functionaliti

# Methodology Per Project
- Utilize the JavaScript fetch function to retrieve server data from a Web API and parse it into objects.
- Employ JavaScript Promises for asynchronous communication with the server.
- Dynamically render document elements using JavaScript Document libraries based on the retrieved data.
- Adopt both Promise error handling and try-catch blocks for error processing.
- Utilize the JavaScript localStorage library for storing and managing client data.
- Transform the web application into a Single Page Application (SPA) to achieve a seamless UI experience, ensuring data is initially rendered after JS load and dynamically updated via event listeners.
- Investigate Web API endpoints, test different parameters, and verify the returned JSON format.
